# [Balatro] BIG BANG by ZJWCY
## A Balatro mod that adds 2 jokers and 1 challenge to the game.
## Jokers
### ・Big Bang
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __Rarity:__ Uncommon

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __Effect:__ During a single play, each Ace, when scoring, causes every subsequent scoring card of the same suit to trigger an additional N times. For every N antes, the value of N doubles. (N is initially set to 1)
### ・Collapse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __Rarity:__ Uncommon

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; __Effect:__ Each card's rank is decreased by 1 before getting scored, except for Aces. At the end of the round, if during the round, no Ace card (even debuffed) has been played, discarded, or scored, upgrade the level of every poker hand played in the round.
